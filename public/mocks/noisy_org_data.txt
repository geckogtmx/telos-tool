MESSAGE FROM THE CEO (Page 3)

Team, 

As we look back on 2025, it's easy to get lost in the numbers. But we must remember why we started this journey.
When we founded Acme in 2020, we set out with a simple mission: **To democratize supply chain efficiency for small businesses.** 
Too often, mom-and-pop shops are priced out of the tools that giants like Amazon use. We exist to fix that broken dynamic.

Our competitors focus on enterprise clients because that's where the easy money is. We do not. 
If an account requires a custom contract or a redline process, they are not our customer. We build for the millions, not the few.
This "No Enterprise Sales" rule has cost us short term revenue, but built long term loyalty.

HR UPDATES - "Employee of the Month"
Congratulations to Sarah in Accounting for organizing the potluck!
Reminder: Open enrollment for health insurance ends on Friday.

CULTURE CORNER
A reminder of our Operating Values (The "Acme Way"):
1. **Speed over perfection.** We ship daily. If it's broken, we fix it tomorrow. waiting is the enemy.
2. **Honest pricing.** No hidden fees. If a customer can't understand the bill in 10 seconds, we failed.
3. **Users first.** We build what they vote for on the roadmap, not what investors think is cool.
